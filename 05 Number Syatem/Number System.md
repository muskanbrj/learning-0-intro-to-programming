# Number System

## Binary Number system (Base = 2)

- It is the actual number system understood by computers
- used to store data in files effectively
- used for data transmission

Digits (2):
- 0
- 1

Ex: (12)<sub>10</sub> = (1100)<sub>2</sub>

## Octal Number system (Base = 8)

- In computing environments, it is commonly used as a shorter representation of binary numbers by grouping binary digits into threes.
- The chmod command in Linux or UNIX uses octal to assign file permissions.

Digits (8):
- 0 to 7

Ex: (12)<sub>10</sub> = (14)<sub>8</sub>


## Decimal Number system (Base = 10)

- Human friendly number system 

Digits (10):
- 0 to 9


## Hexadecimal Number system (Base = 16)

- Used in memory addresses in system
- Used for color codes
- Their small size also makes input-output handling easier compared to other numbering formats

Digits (16):
- 0 to 9
- A (10) to F (16)

Ex:
- (12)<sub>10</sub> = (C)<sub>16</sub>
- (31)<sub>10</sub> = (1F)<sub>16</sub>
