# Parts of language

- Logic : What to do, how to do
- Syntax : How can we make the language do what we need

## Example: 
If we want someone to go to a place and pick something for us, we can directly say to him/ her. But if we want same expectation from a dog or cat, we have to tell them in a way they understand, i.e., sign language, training, etc.  
Here, the result will be same, we know what to do, but to do same thing in different languages, we need to learn different syntax. Logic remains same (or almost same).
