# Algorithm

It is a sequence of steps (statements), when followed leads to a solution of a given problem statement

## Components of an algorithm
1. declaration statements
1. input statements
1. arithmetic operations
1. conditional operations
    1. if-end if
    1. if-else-end if
    1. if-else if-else-end if (aka if-else ladder)
1. loop/ repetitive statements
    1. while-end while
    1. for-end for
1. output statements

## Good Algorithm
1. A good algorithm should produce the correct outputs for any set of legal inputs.
1. A good algorithm should execute efficiently with the fewest number of steps as possible.
1. A good algorithm should be designed in such a way that others will be able to understand it and modify it to specify solutions to additional problems.

## Example

### Problem: **Add 2 numbers.**
Steps:
1. Let `num1` and `num2` be two numbers
1. Read `num1` and `num2`
1. Let `sum = num1 + num2`
1. Display `sum`
1. Stop
